# Pytorch3way

3 ways to implement Pytorch training(original, Pytorch-Lightning and Skorch)
*as an added bonus I may throw in autopytorch(formerly autonet) after the explanation of these three methods *

These notebooks/code will pull from tutorials on the web, Strive School lessons, and my own tinkering
